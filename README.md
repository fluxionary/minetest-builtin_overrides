# builtin_overrides

minor QOL overrides for some builtin behaviors

* sorts player names in `/status` by default
* sorts privs in `/privs`
* don't crash if trying to send a chat message that's too long
* correct capitalization of player names used in builtin commands and APIs (requires `canonical_name`)
